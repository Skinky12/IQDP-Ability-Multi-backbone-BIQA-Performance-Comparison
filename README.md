# IQDP Ability: Multi-backbone BIQA Performance Comparison
This project compares the performance of BIQA models with various backbones. For details, please refer to the paper [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417424022164).
**Important Information:** Before training the model, ensure to create a "results" folder in the same directory to save training outcomes. Additionally, create a "checkpoint" folder, and within it, make a "hugging_face" folder to store the pre-trained model (.bin file).
If you wish to conduct subjective experiments following the steps in the paper, you can download the *Contrast-based IQA Subjective Experiment Application*, which facilitates the experiment process. Note that when using the application, the images should be organized within the "image" folder as follows: "image" -> "modelA_modelB" -> "0" or "1" -> "1", "2", "3", and so on.
